Node.js installed on your local machine.
A web browser for viewing the frontend.

cd react-todo-app

Usage
Start the development server for the React frontend:

 
 
npm start
This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Start the backend server:

Make sure your backend server (e.g., Node.js with Express) is running. Adjust the server endpoints in the React code (axios calls) to match your backend configuration.
Use the application:

Enter a task in the text area and click the "Add Task" button to add a new task.
Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it when it's completed.
